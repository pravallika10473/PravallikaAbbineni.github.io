											<h2>The Wealth of Nations</h2>
											<p>- Adam Smith</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											It is best to learn from the originals, as most newer versions would make stuff complicated. This is the first principle understanding
											of economics.  
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											In this book Adam Smith explains all the way from the division of labour, markets, real value of labor, the origins and use of money, division of stocks, to the 
											systems of political economy, taxes etc all in the form of first principle reasoning, everyone can understand. If you have heard that our currency 
											is backed by gold or about inflation, but never quite understood them, then you would definitely enjoy. I think everyone sholud read this. Don't 
											mind the size of the book, you will appreciate in the end.

											<h2>The Rational Optimist</h2>
											<p>-Matt Ridley</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											Everything by Matt Ridley is worth reading. This book is economics version of why humans are different and dominant species? 
											 It relates Darwins evolution and Adam Smiths economics.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
										     This book shows how exchange and trade became bases for our development, and how natural selection is happening right now in ideas (good ideas in good environment flourish). 
											 After reading this I thought we have to owe our care free childhood to the idea of capital and age old division of labor. This book explains some counter 
											 intuitive things like population collapse and actually generosity increased because of trade etc. How Innovation work by Ridley is also a wonderful book.

											<h2>Zero to One</h2>
											<p>- Peter Thiel</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											This book is from a course that Peter Thiel taught at Stanford. As Thiel puts it doing what we already know
											how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. Every new creation goes from 0 to 1, 
											This book is about how to get there.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											This book takes about the foundations of startups, co-founder dynamics, What it takes to build a successful business and 
											questions you have to ask inorder to be successful, for this he gave example of how Tesla is different from other cleantech startups that went bankcrupt and how
											 Tesla answered all the questions and stood successful.

											<h2>Start with Why</h2>
											<p>- Simon Sinek</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											This book was writen by Simon Sinek after his sensational Ted Talk on the same topic, Start with Why and the golden circle. Simon Sinek is worth following. He goes 
											onto explain the common thing between people like Wright Brothers, Martin Luther King and Steve Jobs who inspired and succeeded
											in their respective domains.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											How successful leaders and companies like Apple, Harley Davidson, Disney regardless of size or industry, think, act and communicate exactly alike.
											This book explains about human side of things. This explains why we have Apple products or Harley Davidson in our bucket list rather than some 
											other similar company products. This book is good to read and worth your time.

											<h2>The Toyota Mindset</h2>
											<p>- Yoshihito Wakam</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											There is a wonderful story of a group of American car executives who went to Japan to see a Japanese assembly line.
											At the end of the line, the doors were put on the hinges, the same as in America. But,in the US, a line
											worker would take a rubber mallet and tap the edges of the door to ensure that it fit perfectly. In Japan, that job
											doesn't seem to exist. Confused, the American auto executives asked about that,the Japan executive smiled and answered
											" We make sure it fits when we design it". 
											If they didn't achieve their desired outcome, they understood it was because of a decision they made at the start of the process. 
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											Though both courses of action may yield similar short-term results, it is what we can't see that makes long-term success more
											predictable for only one. This book sends similar meaning, this is about The Toyota way, wonderful book to read.

											<h2>Creativity, Inc</h2>

											This is Pixars story, how it formed , struggles, internal management, acquisition by Disney. There are many internal philosophies the people
											at Pixar follows that made Pixar a gaint in the computer animation industry.  
										
										</p>
										<p align="justify">

											<h2>Skin In The Game</h2>
											<p>-Nassim Taleb</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											Everything by Nassim Taleb are great, his other books include Black Swan, Antifragile, The Bed of Procrustes are worth your time.
                                            
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											In this book he redefines what it means to understand the world, succeed in a profession, contribute to a fair and just society, detect nonsense, and influence others. Citing examples ranging from Hammurabi to Seneca, Antaeus the Giant to Donald Trump, Nassim Taleb shows how the willingness to accept one’s own risks is an essential attribute of heroes, saints, and flourishing people in all walks of life.
