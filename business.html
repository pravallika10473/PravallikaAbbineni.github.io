											<h2>The Wealth of Nations</h2>
											<p>- Adam Smith</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											It is best to learn from the originals, as most newer versions would complicate stuff. This book is the first principle understanding of economics.

										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											In this book, Adam Smith explains from the division of labor, markets, the real value of labor, the origins and use of money, and the division of stocks, to the systems of political economy, taxes, etc., all in the form of first principle reasoning, everyone can understand. If you have heard that our currency is backed by gold or about inflation, but never quite understood them, then you would enjoy it. Everyone should read this. Don't mind the book size; you will appreciate it.

											<h2>The Rational Optimist</h2>
											<p>-Matt Ridley</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											Everything by Matt Ridley is worth reading. This book is the economic version of why humans are a different and dominant species. It relates Darwin's evolution and Adam Smiths' economics.

										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											This book shows how exchange and trade became bases for our development, and how natural selection is happening right now in ideas (good ideas in a good environment flourish). After reading this, I thought we owe our carefree childhood to the concept of capital and the age-old division of labor. This book explains counterintuitive things like population collapse, increasing generosity because of trade, etc. how Innovation work by Ridley is also an excellent book.

											<h2>Zero to One</h2>
											<p>- Peter Thiel</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											This book is from a course that Peter Thiel taught at Stanford. As Thiel puts it doing what we already know
											how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. Every new creation goes from 0 to 1, 
											This book is about how to get there.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											This book talkes about the foundations of startups, co-founder dynamics, What it takes to build a successful business and 
											questions you have to ask inorder to be successful, for this he gave example of how Tesla is different from other cleantech startups that went bankcrupt and how
											 Tesla answered all the questions and stood successful.

											<h2>Start with Why</h2>
											<p>- Simon Sinek</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											Simon Sinek wrote this book after his sensational Ted Talk on the same topic, Start with Why and the golden circle. Simon Sinek is worth following. He explains the common thing between people like Wright Brothers, Martin Luther King, and Steve Jobs, who inspired and succeeded in their respective domains.

										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											How successful leaders and companies like Apple, Harley Davidson, and Disney, regardless of size or industry, think, act and communicate exactly alike. This book explains the human side of things. This explains why we have Apple products or Harley Davidson on our bucket list rather than some other similar company products. This book is good to read.

											<h2>The Toyota Mindset</h2>
											<p>- Yoshihito Wakam</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											There is a wonderful story of a group of American car executives who went to Japan to see a Japanese assembly line. At the end of the line, the doors were put on the hinges, the same as in America. But, in the US, a line worker would take a rubber mallet and tap the edges of the door to ensure that it fits perfectly. In Japan, that job doesn't seem to exist. Confused, the American auto executives asked about that; the Japanese executive smiled and answered, " We make sure it fits when we design it." If they didn't achieve their desired outcome, they understood it was because of a decision they made at the start of the process.

										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											Though both courses of action may yield similar short-term results, what we can't see makes long-term success more predictable for only one. This book sends identical meaning; this is about The Toyota way, an excellent book to read.

											<h2>Creativity, Inc</h2>
											<p>-Ed Catmull</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											This is Pixars story, how it formed , struggles, internal management, acquisition by Disney. There are many internal philosophies the people
											at Pixar follows that made Pixar a gaint in the computer animation industry.  
										
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											This book tells the stories about those philosophies and how they are formed. One of my faviorite is Always try to hire people 
											who are smarter than you. Always take a chance on better, even it threatens your position. Good to read.

											<h2>Skin In The Game</h2>
											<p>-Nassim Taleb</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											Everything by Nassim Taleb are great, his other books include Black Swan, Antifragile, The Bed of Procrustes are worth your time.
                                            
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											In this book he redefines what it means to understand the world, succeed in a profession, contribute to a fair and just society, detect nonsense, and influence others. Citing examples ranging from Hammurabi to Seneca, Antaeus the Giant to Donald Trump, Nassim Taleb shows how the willingness to accept one’s own risks is an essential attribute of heroes, saints, and flourishing people in all walks of life.
