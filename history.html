											<h2>Sapiens</h2>
											<p>- Yuval Noah Harrari</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											This is the famous book about why humans became the dominant species on earth. I used to hate history in school; for me, this book showed that history could be more than dates.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											The author argues that our ability to imagine fiction made us the dominant species. He explains this by giving examples like money, law, and corporations. Everything from our long-lost cousins to the recent scientific revolution is wonderfully narrated and shows how we aspire to become Homo Deus(gods). One of the best books you can read.

											<h2>The Big History Project</h2>
											<p>- David Christian</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											Everyone should watch this; It's 13.8 billion years of condensed history. They divided this into eight thresholds, which are very low-probability events we must cross to form.

										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											In a universe where entropy rules the day, the presence of life with such organization, structure, and stability is stunning. How that happened, and the required conditions that must be met to form life is what you get out of this. Trust me, the time you spend watching this will make you appreciate your life even more. After watching this, I felt my chances of being born were very low compared to being successful like Elon Musk, so I have already achieved something rare, so relax. Jokes aside, watch this.
