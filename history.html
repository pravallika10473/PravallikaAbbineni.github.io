											<h2>Sapiens</h2>
											<p>- Yuval Noah Harrari</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											This is the famous book about Why we humans became the dominant species on earth? I used to hate history in school, for me this
											is the book that showed history can be more than dates.  
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											Author argues that our ability to imagine fiction made us dominant species. He explains this by giving examples like money, law and corporations. 
											Everything from our long lost cousins to recent scientific revolution wonderfully narrated in a story format and also shows how we are aspiring to become Homo Deus(gods).
											One of the best book you can read.

											<h2>The Big History Project</h2>
											<p>- David Christian</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											I think everyone should watch this, It's 13.8 billion years condensed history.
											They divided this into 8 thresholds, which are very low probable events that we have to cross inorder to form.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
										   In a universe where entropy rules the day, the presence of life with such organization, structure, and stability is stunning. How that happened, what are the required conditions that has to be met is what you get out of this.
										   Trust me the time you spend in watching this will make you appreciate your life even more. After watching this I felt like the chances of me being born was very low compared to me being successful like Elon Musk, so I have already achieved something rare, relax. Jokes aside watch this.
