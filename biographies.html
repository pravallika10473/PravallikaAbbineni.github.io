											<h2>The Code Breaker</h2>
											<p>- Walter Isaacson</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											The Code Breaker is a gripping account of how the pioneering scientist Jennifer Doudna (2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner), along with her colleagues and rivals, launched a revolution that will allow us to cure diseases and fend off viruses. Jennifer Doudna and her collaborators created an easy-to-use tool that can edit DNA, known as CRISPR, it opened a brave new world of medical miracles and moral questions. 
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											 Many problems can be solved through gene editing, but at the same time it can have many moral complications. As always Isaacson explained everything well.

										<p align="justify">
											I don't need to say anything about this, just go for it if you haven't already. This is one of the first books I read. The thing that caught my attention back when I picked this book was the Apple's Think Different campaign slogan on its first page: "The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.".

											<h2>The Innovators</h2>
											<p>- Walter Isaacson</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											In the words of Isaacson :"The computer and the Internet are among the most important inventions of our era, but few people know who created them. They were not conjured by solo inventors suitable
											to be singled out on magazine covers or put into a pantheon with Edison, Bell, and Morse. Instead, most of the
											innovations of the digital age were done colloboratively. This is the story of these pioneers, hackers, inventors, and entrepreneurs- who they were, how their 
											mind worked, and what made them so creative". This include Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing, Steve Jobs and many more. A must read. The other biographies on Albert Einstein and Leonardo Da Vinci by Isaacson are worth your time.

											<h2>Shoe Dog</h2>
											<p>- Phil Knight</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											This is the funniest biography I have ever read, full of adventure and wit. This book is a memoir by the creator of Nike, Phil Knight.

										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											This book starts from his initial days after Phil Knight's MBA at Stanford and how he implemented his research paper which he proposed at a seminar on entrepreneurship in one of his classes which he calls his crazy idea. Some of my favorite stories from the book were how he read a book on how to do business with Japanese people on a plane and how he instantly came up with a fake name during a meeting for his company, Blue Ribbon, which doesn't exist. This shows the adventure of a man who believed in his crazy idea and made it one of the most successful companies of our time; a must-read; you can complete this in one sitting; it's hard to keep this book down.

											<h2>Elon Musk</h2>
											<p>- Ashlee Vance</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											I picked this book to know what the author is going to tell me that I don't know about Elon, well I was right, I already know everything because I have never left any interview or blog post about him, but if you are not as crazy as me and wants to know about him, then the author done a good job in giving insights into his life.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											Apart from this book there is this great blog post series(<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/03/elon-musk-post-series.html" target="_blank"> The Elon Musk post series </a>) on Elon, Industries he is working on and how he thinks by Tim Urban of Wait But Why, which I highly recommend.

											<h2>Richard Branson</h2>
											<p>-Richard Branson</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											For starters, Sir Richard Branson is a high school dropout and founder of Virgin Group, which today controls over 400 companies in various industries, including Virgin Galactic, a space flight company, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Voyages, and many more.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											This is more of an adventure. In this book, we can learn how he started some of his companies, like Virgin Atlantic, in a single moment of thought while a trip back from the Necker Island visit and rivalry with British Airlines, his Air Baloon adventures around the world. A good book to read.
