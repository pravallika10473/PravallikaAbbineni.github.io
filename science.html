											<h2>The Beginning of Infinity</h2>
											<p>- David Deutsch</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											This book is more of a phenomenon, by far my favorite book. This book answers the questions like, No human has ever been at the surface of a star, let alone visited the core where the transmutation happens and the energy is produced then How do we know that? one of
											the most remarkable thing about science is the contrast between the enormous reach and the precarious, local means by which we create them.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											 Dauetch thinks where everyone stops, any one with little knowledge in astrophysics agrees that how typical we are, how 
											 insignificant we are in this grand cosmos, but author shows how we are significant, how we are not typical. The explanations for rejecting the many 
											 truisms like The Spaceship Earth metaphor are really awesome. This book is somewhat hard to read, but even if you can manage to read 2-3 pages, I
											 guarantee, you will end up much more wiser.

											<h2>The Fabric of Reality</h2>
											<p>-David Deutsch</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											This book is predecessor of the Beginning of Infinity. The entire point of science is to help us understand the world we live in—the "fabric of reality'' hence the title.
											This book deals with everything from parallel universes, quantum theory to time travel.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											To that end, he outlines a new view of the multiverse (the total of all the parallel universes), combining ideas from four "strands" of science: quantum physics, epistemology, the theory of computation, and modern evolutionary theory.
											Anything by Deutsch is worth reading, these two books by him can be in your re-read list, because you will always get something new out of reading these.

											<h2>Life 3.0</h2>
											<p>- Max Tegmark</p>
										</header>
										
										<p align="justify">
											Life 3.0 is entity which can update both it's hardware and software i.e AI. We are Life 2.0 that means me cannot update our hardware (body) which can only be changed through evolution(sort of), but we can update
											our software (mind), which is not now same as when we were born.This 
											book is about artificial intelligence and us, our future as a species.
										</p>
										<p align="justify"> 
											I think this is the best book in the category of books about AI, Tegmark with his physics touch made this book even more wonderful to read. He explores questions like
											what is intelligence? what career advise would you give today's kids? Importance of consciousness etc. This is the book that inspired me to learn AI and ML.

											<h2>The Future of Humanity</h2>
											<p>- Michio Kaku</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											This book is everything that you need to know about space from the history of space race to aliens and future of humans among stars.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											This book starts with why leave earth or why being multiplanetary species in the first place? then goes onto tell about our potential future homes,
											how initial people are going to live on the new planet? How we are going to convert mars to earth like planet? How we are going to travel to other stars? 
											and also about Aliens, Kardashev scale of civilization, Fermi Paradox and Dyson Spheres. This is an extensive read about space travel, a good book to read.

											<h2>Thing Explainer</h2>
											<p>- Randall Munroe</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											Munroe sets out to explain various subjects—from how smartphones work to what the U.S. Constitution says—without any complicated terms. Instead he draws blueprint-style diagrams and annotates them using only the 1,000 most common words in the English language. Saturn V rocket is "Up-Goer five." A dishwasher is a “box that cleans food holders.” The periodic table is “the pieces everything is made of.”
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											Thing Explainer is filled with cool basic knowledge about how the world works. From helicopters to a human cell, a fascinating illustrated guide to the science and technology of everyday life.
