											Lewis Hamilton, Michael Jordan, Tom Brady, Kobe Bryant, Cristiano Ronaldo, Roger Federer,  Warren Buffet, Tom Cruise, and Mr. Beast are all G.O.A.Ts in their respective fields. How do they become like that?  Is it purely 10,000 hours?  Popularized by Malcolm Gladwell the key to becoming world-class in any field is to practice a specific task for at least 10,000 hours. Obviously, there is no magic in the 10,000th hour, but it is true that you need to put in a lot of work to become world-class in any task. However, the important question is this, “What should that work look like? If you want to become great at your craft either physical or intellectual, what exactly should you do with your 10,000 hours?”

								<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
									For any given subject or phenomenon, the y-axis represents the complexity, and the x-axis represents your degree of understanding. You start on the left with low complexity and understanding of any new subject. This means you have a lot of wrong assumptions and do not know how all the pieces fit together; you might think you know, but you are most likely wrong. As your understanding grows, the complexity increases as well. You learn that many of the assumptions you had were inaccurate or overly simplistic and that there is a lot more complexity to the interactions of all different variables than you taught. But after you understand more, things get simpler again. Everything “makes sense,” and you know which factors matter, so you can now focus on these few variables when analyzing the subject. This is known as simplicity on the other side of complexity. Things get simpler after putting enough time and energy into understanding them. 

								</p>
								<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
									Let us consider a very basic example :

								</p>
								
								<section>
									<div>
										<h3 align="justify" style="margin: 30px;"> Amateur Simplicity</h3>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											Consider the ancient greek myth for explaining the annual onset of winter. Long ago, Hades, god of the underworld, kidnapped Persephone, goddess of spring. Then Persephone’s mother, Demeter, goddess of the earth and agriculture, negotiated a contract for her daughter’s release, which specified that Persephone would marry Hades and eat a magic seed that would compel her to visit him once a year. After that whenever Persephone was away, fulfilling this obligation, Demeter became sad and would command the world to become cold and bleak so that nothing could grow.

										</p>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											This myth, though comprehensively false, does constitute an explanation of seasons, which explains why we observe winter at the same time every year. This is an example of our understanding on the left side of the curve; simple and explains the phenomena, but fundamentally wrong.

										</p>
										<h3 align="justify" style="margin: 30px;"> Increasing Complexity</h3>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											If the cause of winter is Demeter’s periodic sadness, then winter must happen everywhere on Earth at the same time.  But the warm growing season occurs in Australia at the very moment when, as greeks believed, Demeter is at her saddest. So once ancient greeks started studying this and observed that seasons around the world are not the same, they could have realized that they overly simplified their explanation, and the world is even more complex than they had thought. With their current understanding, they cannot predict any place's climate without being there.  This is the state in which most of us are stuck. We know it's complex and knows a bunch of fancy names, but deep down we know they are just coverups. We just can't simply derive from the mental model we had if we need something.

										</p>
										<h3 align="justify" style="margin: 30px;"> Experts Simplicity</h3>
										<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 80px; width:50%">
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Seasons.jpg" /></a>
										</div>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											Now consider the true explanation of seasons. It is that the Earth’s axis of rotation is tilted relative to the plane of its orbit around the sun. Hence for half of each year, the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun while the southern hemisphere is tilted away, and for the other half, it is the other way around. Whenever the sun’s rays are falling vertically in one hemisphere ( thus providing more heat per unit area of the surface), they are falling obliquely in the other ( thus providing less). 
With axis tilt theory, put yourself in the place of an ancient astronomer who never traveled more than a few hundred kilometers from his home island. No problem; from the axis-tilt theory of seasons, you can make predictions about the weather in the literally unheard-of places beyond your known world.  Things became simple again. This is the nature of all scientific explanations. One of the most remarkable things about science is the contrast between the enormous reach and power of our best theories and the precarious, local means by which we create them.  ( If you want to know how exactly you can differentiate between scientific and non-scientific explanations try reading the book The Beginning of Infinity by David Deutch) 

										</p>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											Unless you want to be a master in a very new field, you can find already existing good explanations that can help you derive things without memorization.  Be mindful of the explanations you hold; are they making stuff complicated or simple? This is also the First Principle Reasoning. One thing you should take out of this is you need to learn frameworks and fundamentals that will let you build upon them. 

										</p>
										<h3 align="justify" style="margin: 30px;"> Deliberate Practice</h3>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											You can not ride a bike just by reading a book on how to ride a bike, you have to practice or apply what you learned. Even though this sounds obvious, we most of the time miss this when we self-learn, especially for intellectual skills. Watching educational videos and reading books feels like learning, but it won't lead to actual mastery. While regular practice might include mindless repetitions, deliberate practice requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance. 

										</p>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											One of my favorite stories about deliberate practice is how Benjamin Franklin used deliberate practice to improve his writing skills. When he was a teenager, Benjamin Franklin was criticized by his father for his poor writing skills, unlike other teenagers, young Ben took his father’s advice and vowed to improve his writing ability through deliberate practice.

										</p>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											He started reading the journals written by top writers and noted down the meaning of each paragraph, and wrote the whole article in his own words. Later compared it to the original writing, and each time he discovered some of his faults and corrected them. He learned that his vocabulary is holding him back, so he started focussing on improving his vocabulary.

										</p>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											Deliberate practice is hard as it requires thinking, which is somewhat unpleasant for most of us, we try to avoid it where possible, mostly because our brain wants to conserve energy.  It’s helpful to know how our brain works, one way of modeling how the brain operates is as there are two systems at work, psychologists call them system one and system two. 

										</p>
										<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 80px; width:50%">
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/systems.png" /></a>
										</div>
                                        <p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											System 1 is autopilot,  and incredibly quick, which it needs to be since it is constantly processing copious amounts of information coming in through your senses. Processing relevant information while discarding useless information and it works automatically without you, while system 2 represents conscious thought, the voice in your head which is capable of following instructions. If you are asked to calculate 16 multiplied by 18 in your head, system 2 is the one that is going to do that. System 2 is lazy, it takes effort to get system 2 to do anything and it is a slow but careful one capable of catching and fixing mistakes.
										</p>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											System 1 automatic responses are made possible by long-term memory, the library of experiences you’ve built up over your lifetime. In contrast, system 2 exists entirely within working memory. Learning is essentially automating the process, transferring system 2 processes to system 1. In order for this to happen, first system 2 has to engage with the information actively and effortfully, often multiple times. For example, when you first learned to tie your shoes you had to think carefully about each step of the process. Today, after many repetitions, your brain can perform this sequence automatically. Ninety-Nine percent of the time what appears to be superhuman ability, comes down to the incredible automation skills of system 1, developed through the painstaking deliberate practice of system 2.  Sports stars call this muscle memory.

										</p>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											Deliberate practice involves focusing on what is beyond one’s current skill set rather than just executing what one is already able to do.  If the task is too easy or comfortable system 1 will be in charge and it does not involve conscious engagement, so we have to level up, then system 1 essentially passes the task to system 2  which has the ability to remember the experience and can catch and fix the mistakes.

										</p>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											Deliberate practice automatizes skills and concepts so they become faster, more accurate, less variable, and less effortful to execute. This allows people to see new patterns and frees cognitive resources so people can attempt more complex tasks. Additionally, deliberate practice leads to a reorganization of knowledge about a domain, such as a reorganization of physics questions based on conceptual similarities rather than perceptual similarities. There’s an appeal to doing things you already know, for the musician to play the same familiar songs that system 1 has already automated, that feel and sound good, and watch videos that give you the sensation of understanding without mastering anything. But if you really want to learn and get better at anything, you have to be willing to be uncomfortable.


										</p>
										<h3 align="justify" style="margin: 30px;"> Timely feedback</h3>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											Perhaps the greatest difference between deliberate practice and simple repetition is this: feedback. Practice and Feedback are intertwined. As discussed above in the case of Ben Franklin, he not only practiced writing, he compared it to the original writing in order to find his mistakes and improve. Timely feedback is essential for improvement, otherwise, you will end up practicing in a vacuum. You have to know what’s working and what’s not.  Getting timely feedback is even more important to learn quickly. 


										</p>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											Let's see an example for good and bad deliberate practice: <br>
Good: A basketball player starts practice by shooting one hundred free throws. In each shot he focuses on his balance and knee bend, striving for perfect form.<br>
Bad: A basketball player starts practice by shooting two hundred free throws while chatting with a friend and without focusing on form. While this player put up more shots, the quality of the practice was neither effortful nor focused. 


										</p>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											The difference between good and bad practice is timely feedback,  good practice as described above looks for what’s working and what’s not and how to change accordingly, bad practice is just mindless practice.


										</p>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											One thing we all have to deal with feedback is sunk cost fallacy, the phenomenon whereby a person is reluctant to abandon a strategy or course of action because they have heavily invested in it, either by time, effort or money, even when it is clear that abandonment would be more 
beneficial. 


										</p>
										<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 80px; width:70%">
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/concorde1.jpg" /></a>
										</div>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											One of the examples of not taking feedback and falling into the sunk cost fallacy is Concorde, a supersonic jet developed in the ’60s. The initial estimated cost for development was 100 million dollars, however halfway through they realized it would cost a lot more than that and the plane would never make up for the cost, Did they stop? No, they thought it would be better to complete it as they already invested time and money into it. The final development cost reached two billion dollars and Concorde operated for only thirty years and never make up for the money spent. We are all vulnerable to sunk-in cost fallacy. 


										</p>
										<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 80px; width:70%">
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/mountain.jpeg" /></a>
										</div>
										<p align="justify" style="margin: 30px;">
											To put this into perspective if you find a mountain and you start climbing it, and you spend your whole life climbing it and you get say two-thirds of the way. And then you see the peak is like way up there, but you are two-thirds of the way, you are still really high up. But now, to go the rest of the way, you have to go back down to the bottom and look for another path. Nobody wants to do that, people don’t want to start over and it’s natural that later in life you just don’t have the time. So it’s very painful to go back down and look for a new path, but that may be the best thing to do.  Remember this analogy every time you are not taking feedback and falling into the sunk cost fallacy, even though you reached two-thirds of the way, doing anything on the same path won't take you anywhere, you have to find another path that takes you to the top even though it requires you to start over.
