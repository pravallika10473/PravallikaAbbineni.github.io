											<h2>Six Easy Pieces</h2>
											<p>- Richard Feynman</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											As Hans Bethe puts it, 'There are two types of genius. Ordinary geniuses do great things, but they leave you
											room to believe that you could do the same if only you worked hard enough. Then there are magicians, and you 
											can have no idea how they do it. Feynman was a magician'
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											As the name suggests this book is about six relatively easy topics in physics explained by its most brilliant 
											teacher. Feynman connects everything neatly and intuitively. This book covers atoms, basic physics, energy,
											gravity, quantum mechanics and the relationship of physics to other topics. I have studied thermodynamics in 
											school for 2-3 years, but this is the book that taught me what's in reality the speed of atoms means(Thermometers
											for us are speedometers for atoms). I highly recommend this to anyone, its easy to read, no jargon and brilliant at the same time.

											<h2>Six Not-So-Easy Pieces</h2>
											<p>-Richard Feynman</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											Six Not-So-Easy Pieces, like its predecessor, Six Easy Pieces, is a collection of six lectures culled from Feynman's well-known Lectures on Physics. While the earlier collection concentrated on what might be considered the stuff of a first-year physics course (with a chapter on quantum mechanics thrown in for spice), this second collection examines the more glamorous side of physics: relativity and space-time. 
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											If you have heard about the twin paradox, Space-Time, Curved Space but never 
											quite understood them, then this book is for you. It covers the essential maths from symmetry in 
											physical laws to lorentz transformations and explains the most unintuitive concepts clearly. This book also 
											offers an explanation as to why Newton could not have discovered the theory of special relativity.

											<h2>A Brief History of Time</h2>
											<p>- Stephen Hawking</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											This book needs no introduction, explores such profound questions as: How did the universe begin—and what made its start possible? Does time always flow forward? Is the universe unending—or are there boundaries? Are there other dimensions in space? What will happen when it all ends?
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											 This book covers all the way from the big bang to the death of the universe, and the unification of physics(i.e the theory of everything). If you have seen the Christopher Nolan's movie Tenet and wondered how on earth does the reversal of time is 
											 possible, then you might like the explanation covered in one of the chapters, The Arrow of Time. And the other books by Stephen Hawking like Brief Answers to the Big Questions and Black Holes are worth your time.

											<h2>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</h2>
											<p>- Carlo Rovelli</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
										
											This seven short lessons covers all the cool stuff of physics, even though you already know some topics, you sometimes need
											a new perspective, or just reframing of words to fully appreciate the concepts, this is that book. You cannot see anywhere that simple 
											explanations in quantum mechanics, author explains with matchless clarity and one of the entertaining read.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											The seven lessons are about Einstein's general theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, the architecture of the cosmos, elementary particles, quantum gravity, probability and the heat of black holes and, finally, how humans fit into this picture. 
										<p>

											<h2>Reality is not what it seems</h2>
											<p>- Carlo Rovelli</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											Physics, poetry, philosophy, and history packed in a very accessible form. In a famous myth related by plato in the seventh book of
											Republic, some men are chained at the bottom of a dark cave and see only shadows cast upon a wall by a fire behind them. They think
											that this is reality. One of them frees himself, leaves the cave and discovers the wider world. At first he was stunned and confused, eventually he returns excited to
											his companions to tell them what he has seen. They find it hard to believe.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											As the author describes we are all in the depths of a cave, and our weak senses reveal to us only shadows. This is the book that explains the current understanding of our world according to science.
                                            So this is the book on history and science of quantum gravity.

											<h2>Thinking Physics</h2>
											<p>-Lewis Carroll Epstein</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											There is this great pitch on the back of this book that says, "The only book used in both grade school and graduate school".
											That is absolutely true. That's the feynman technique, If you cannot explain it to a 12 year old, then you don't understand it. 
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											This is a more general book on physics, can be recommended to anyone. It is a Q and A book for all ages, It answers questions like how tides work, wing lift, 
											artificial aurora created by hydrogen bombs etc. This book is filled with hand-drawn illustrations, completely entertaining, one that can be reread.
