														<h3>Traffic Sign detection</h3>
													
													</header>
													<p align="justify">
														In this project, I used TensorFlow to build a neural network to classify road signs based on an image of those signs. In particular, this involves the ability to recognize and distinguish road signs – stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and more. To do so, a labeled dataset: a collection of images that have already been categorized by the road sign represented in them is required.

Several such data sets exist, but for this project, I used the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of road signs.

														<h3>The game of Nim with AI opponent</h3>
													
													</header>
													<p align="justify">
														In the game Nim, we begin with some number of piles, each with some number of objects. Players take turns: on a player’s turn, the player removes any non-negative number of objects from any one non-empty pile. Whoever removes the last object loses.
														In this problem, an AI learned the strategy for this game through reinforcement learning. By playing games against itself repeatedly and learning from experience, eventually AI learned which actions to take and which actions to avoid. In particular Q-learning was used for this project.

														<h3>User behaviour prediction in online shopping</h3>
													
													</header>
													<p align="justify">
														When users are shopping online, not all will end up purchasing something. It will be useful for a shopping website to be able to predict whether a user intends to make a purchase or not: perhaps displaying different content to the user, like showing the user a discount offer if the website believes the user isn’t planning to complete the purchase.
                                                        Implemented a nearest-neighbor classifier to solve this problem, Given information about a user — how many pages they’ve visited, whether they’re shopping on a weekend, what web browser they’re using, etc. 12,000 user sessions are used while training. Sensitivity, true positive rate of 38 percent and specificity, true negetive rate of 91 percent are achieved.

														<h3>Crossword Puzzle</h3>
													
													</header>
													<p align="justify">
														Given the structure of a crossword puzzle (i.e., which squares of the grid are meant to be filled in with a letter), and a list of words to use, the problem becomes one of choosing which words should go in each vertical or horizontal sequence of squares. We can model this sort of problem as a constraint satisfaction problem. Each sequence of squares is one variable, for which we need to decide on its value (which word in the domain of possible words will fill in that sequence). 
                                                        At the command line it takes the empty structure of the puzzle, words to be filled into them as inputs and completes the puzzle as above.

														<h3>PageRank</h3>
													
													</header>
													<p align="justify">
														When search engines like Google display search results, they do so by placing more important and higher-quality pages higher in the search results than less important pages. In this project, I implement two methods – sampling pages from a Markov Chain random surfer and by iteratively applying the PageRank formula for calculating PageRank.
														Program takes command-line argument, which will be the name of a directory of a corpus of web pages we’d like to compute PageRanks for. Ultimately, both algorithms return a dictionary where the keys are each page name and the values are each page’s estimated PageRank (a number between 0 and 1).

														<h3>Minesweeper</h3>
													
													</header>
													<p align="justify">
														Minesweeper is a puzzle game that consists of a grid of cells, where some of the cells contain hidden “mines.” Clicking on a cell that contains a mine detonates the mine, and causes the user to lose the game. Clicking on a “safe” cell reveals a number that indicates how many neighboring cells – where a neighbor is a cell that is one square to the left, right, up, down, or diagonal from the given cell – contain a mine.
														The goal of this project is to implemnet a knowledge-based agent that make decissions by considering the knowledge base, and making inferences based on that knowledge.

														<h3>Knights and Knaves</h3>
													
													</header>
													<p align="justify">
														In a Knights and Knaves puzzle, the following information is given: Each character is either a knight or a knave. A knight will always tell the truth: if knight states a sentence, then that sentence is true. Conversely, a knave will always lie: if a knave states a sentence, then that sentence is false.
														The objective of the puzzle is, given a set of sentences spoken by each of the characters, determine, for each character, whether that character is a knight or a knave.
														In this AI reasons based on existing knowledge and draws conclusions.

														<h3>Degrees</h3>
													
													</header>
													<p align="justify">
														According to the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game, anyone in the Hollywood film industry can be connected to Kevin Bacon within six steps, where each step consists of finding a film that two actors both starred in.

                                            In this, we’re interested in finding the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them.
											This program takes input names of 2 actors and uses breadth-first search and finds the shortest seperation between two actors using imdb database.

														This project is about recovering accidentally deleted JPEG images from a memory card.
											As in the computer world, "deleted" tends not to mean "deleted" so much as "forgotten". This can be 
											done through iterating over a copy of memory card, looking for JPEG specific signatures. Code is in recover.c

														<h3>Image Filters</h3>
													
													</header>
													<p align="justify">
														This project implements Grayscale filter, Reflection filter, Blur Filter, and Edge Filter.
											Grayscale filter converts an input color image into a black-and-white image. Reflection filter produces a reflection of a 
											given image. 
											Blur filter  blurs the whole image by softening an image. And the final edge detection detects the edges in the given image,
											this particular one can be used in artificial intelligence algorithms for image processing. Sobel operator was applied.
