											<h2>The Selfish Gene</h2>
											<p>- Richard Dawkins</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											The idea was this: genes strive for immortality, and individuals, families, and species are merely vehicles in that quest hence, metaphorically, they are selfish. This is the second most influencial book on evolution after Darwin's Origins of spieces.

										</p>
										<p>
											This gene-centric view of evolution also began to explain one of the oddities of life on Earth – the behaviour of social insects. What is the point of a drone bee, doomed to remain childless and in the service of queen? Suddenly it made sense that, with the gene itself steering evolution, the fact that the drone shared its DNA with the queen meant that it guarantees not the individual’s survival, but the endurance of the genes they share.
											Dawkins coined the term meme. The best book you can read, really interesting.

											<h2>Genome</h2>
											<p>-Matt Ridley</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											The human genome—the complete set of human genes—comes packaged in twenty-three separate pairs of chromosomes. Ridley goes onto explain about 23 chromosomes individually, what are the traits associated with each chromosome. For example Chromosome 4 is called Fate, because a certain gene that inevitably causes disease resides there. Chromosome 11 is home to genes that affect personality etc
										</p>
										<p>
										    The relationship between genetic language and health is pretty compelling, and Ridley does a superb job of making it vividly clear. Great book to read, you will enjoy.

											<h2>The Origns of Virtue</h2>
											<p>- Matt Ridley</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											In Ridley's words, This is a book about human nature, and in particular the surprisingly social nature of the human animal. We live in towns, work in teams, and our lives are spiders' webs of connections - linking us to relatives, colleagues, companions, friends, superiors, inferiors. We cannot live without one another.
											Even on a practical level, it is probably a million years since any human being was entirely self- sufficient.
										</p>
										<p>
											No single human knows how to manufacture a cell phone from start to finish. All the development in the human world is through collective knowledge, no animal can do this, this book explains how we do that. A must read.
										</p>
